Explanation of Changes:
setapikey Command:

This command is used to set or update the Torn API key. It uses RED's configuration system to store the API key securely.
The @checks.is_owner() decorator ensures that only the bot owner can set or change the API key, providing an extra layer of security.
Dynamic API Key Handling:

In the check_for_purchases method, the API key is fetched dynamically using await self.config.api_key(). This ensures that the latest API key is always used for requests.
If the API key is not set, the bot will skip making API requests and print a message, checking again after the sleep interval.
Error Handling:

Added checks to ensure the API key is present before making requests, preventing unnecessary errors if the key hasn't been set.
Using the Bot with the Updated Cog
Load the Cog: Use the command [p]load tornmonitor to load the cog, where [p] is your bot's prefix.

Set the API Key:

As the bot owner, you can set the API key using:
```!setapikey your_torn_api_key_here```
Replace ! with your bot's command prefix.
Add and Remove Users:

Add users to monitor with:
```!adduser <user_id>```
Remove users from monitoring with:
```!removeuser <user_id>```
Run the Bot:

Ensure the bot is running and that it's monitoring the specified users. It will send messages to the designated channel whenever purchases are detected.
This cog setup provides flexibility to dynamically manage the Torn API key and user IDs, allowing for real-time monitoring and updates directly from Discord.
